Week 1
stat2_01_orientation_and_inference_roadmap
Compact title: Orientation & Inference Roadmap
Core topics: inference workflow; parameters vs statistics; sampling mindset; common assumptions (independent observations, measurement reliability); how Ch8–13 connect.
Lab: reproducible data workflow; “simulate-first” preview of sampling variability (mean and proportion).
Reading: B1 Required Ch1.1–1.2 (selected); B2 Recommended Ch1; B3 Optional 5.1–5.5; B4 Optional.

Week 2
Compact title: Sampling Dist I
Core topics: random sampling; key statistics (x̄, s², p̂) as RVs; sampling distribution concept; standard error as “typical error.”
Lab: simulation of x̄ and p̂ for multiple n; visualize SE shrinking.
Reading: B1 Required Ch8.1–8.3; B2 Recommended 8.1–8.3; B3 Optional 4.1; B4 Optional.
Compact title: Sampling Dist I Core topics: random sampling; key statistics (x̄, s², p̂) as RVs; sampling distribution concept; standard error as “typical error.” Reading: B1 Required Ch8.1–8.3; B2 Recommended 8.1–8.3; B3 Optional 4.1; B4 Optional.

Week 3
Compact title: Sampling Dist II (CLT)
Core topics: CLT; when it works; practical normal approximation logic; interpreting “approximately Normal.”
Lab: CLT simulation under skew/heavy tails; compare tail areas across n.
