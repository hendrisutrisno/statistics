Expectation and Variance as Practical Summaries

E[X] as long-run average; Var/SD as variability in units

Compute E and Var for discrete models using formulas and simple sums

Interpretation in cost/risk terms (expected loss, expected downtime)

Linearity of expectation as a practical shortcut (no proofs)
