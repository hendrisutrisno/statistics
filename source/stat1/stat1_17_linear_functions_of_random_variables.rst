Linear Functions of Random Variables (applied)

Mean and variance of aX+b (scaling and shifting)

Mean and variance of sums (independent case emphasized; covariance mentioned qualitatively)

Practical use: total cost = fixed + variable; total time = sum of stages

Common hazard: assuming independence without justification
