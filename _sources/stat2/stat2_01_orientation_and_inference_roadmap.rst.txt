Week 01 — stat2_01_orientation_and_inference_roadmap.rst
Compact title: Orientation & Inference Roadmap
In-class focus: course workflow; review “what Stat 1 knowledge is assumed” (RV, mean/variance, Normal model, basic probability); what sampling distributions enable (CI/tests/regression).
Lab focus: software setup; data import; basic descriptive workflow; confidence-interval preview using simulation (procedural, not theory).
Reading:

B1: Required (Introduction/overview sections; same topics as B1 Ch1 “role of probability + samples/populations”)

B2: Recommended Ch1 (engineering method/statistical thinking)

B3: Optional 5.1–5.5 (why statistics; types of inferences)
