Core topics: covariance/correlation as tools; scatterplot-first workflow; outliers and nonlinearity; clarify “independence of observations” vs “X independent of Y” vs “errors unrelated to X.”
Lab: correlation pitfalls using simulated + real datasets; visual diagnostics; short pre-regression mini-case.
