Continuous Models I: Uniform and Exponential (core)

Uniform as baseline model (range-limited uncertainty)

Exponential as waiting time with constant rate

Mean of exponential (1/λ) and tail probability interpretation

Applications: service waiting, time-to-failure with constant hazard (conceptual)
