Applied Probability and Random Variables for Engineering and Management
Math level: high-school calculus intuition only (area under curve; no limit theorems; no inequalities; no proof-based topics).
Design intent: build strong modeling fluency with a small set of distributions and strong interpretation/communication.


Course Roadmap and Statistical Thinking in Engineering/Management

What statistics is used for (quality, risk, forecasting inputs, decision support)

Population vs sample; parameter vs statistic (terminology discipline)

Types of studies (retrospective/observational/experiment) at a practical level

“Modeling mindset”: assumptions, scope, and limitations
