# Introduction

Welcome to *learning-statistics* — a personal collection of notes, demos, and curated resources for learning statistics.

This small site is designed to be:
- Simple: write content as markdown files inside `content/`
- Lightweight: static files + a small JS loader
- Portable: serve with any static host (GitHub Pages, Netlify, local http.server)

How to add content
1. Add a markdown file in `content/<section>/` (for example `content/foundations/my-topic.md`)
2. Add an entry for it in `content/structure.json` under the section you want
3. Open the site and click the new page in the sidebar

Place images for this section inside `content/getting-started/images/`.

Happy learning!
